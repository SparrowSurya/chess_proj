-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìã TASKS:
-----------------------------------------------------
special moves
    pawn promotion  (current)
        make proper interface to select piece (for temporary just input())
        also for now you can choose any player you want
    en-passon
    castelling

menus + other gui additions

gui class for gui.__init__ (current)

‚ùó no two colurs be the same

tile highlight wont be having solid color an overlay will be used for that



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEMS:
-----------------------------------------------------
ANNOYING:
    sometimes the drag drop becomes glitchy showing piece at improper position (in gui only)

CURRENT:
    grid dont get updated (src/__init__.py line 227) ie still shows pawn instead queen (4 now hardcoded for proper result)
    even through same statement working in same file in line 216

    make sure that during pawn promotion it have no characteristics of pawn but of the desired piece
    still checks for canmove attribute

    the gui implementation for AskPromotion has been implemented properly


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üõ†Ô∏è CHANGE:
-----------------------------------------------------
In future will be using pillow library to give some attractive looking interface



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìù LATER:
-----------------------------------------------------
make colours based upon hex code so as to be good in future use

to make custom color picker (most probably circular one) instead tkinter.colorchooser 

-- drag drop and click to move has some flaw (as per my expectation)
