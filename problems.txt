1.
TCLERROR: (fixed)
    as canvas is extended when there are no cells further on clicking 2nd time it raises error
@solved by defining size of canvas

2.
IMAGE NOT EXIST: (fixed)
    config takes help of config.configure to get the path of directory as per user settings
    config(__init__) package knows that from where the images need to be fetched
    gui.ipath uses that info to provide the relative path (wrt to test.py file) to fetch the images
@solved by giving filepath as kwarg in PhotoImage
